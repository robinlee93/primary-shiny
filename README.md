# primary-shiny

I created a shiny dashboard to show how GOP candidates' poll average compare to their facebook presence. 
I measure facebook presence as the ratio of the number of shares on the candidate's facebook posts to the total number of shares among GOP candidates during that week. 
I made this choice because facebook, compared to twitter, tends to capture more middle-aged and older voters. I use the ratio to make two measures instead of cumulative number of followers, because I care about the relative performance. This way, both metrics will be on % scale.
